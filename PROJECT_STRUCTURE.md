# Project Structure & File Descriptions

This document provides a brief explanation of every file in your **AccountBook** application.

## Root Directory

| File Match | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`main.py`** | **The Entry Point**. This is the script you run to start the app. It initializes the Flask server, checks the database, and automatically launches your web browser. |
| **`routes.py`** | **The Brains**. Contains all the "Routes" (URL paths). It defines what happens when you visit `/login`, `/transactions`, `/ledger`, etc. It handles the logic for filtering, editing, and deleting data. |
| **`models.py`** | **The Database Schema**. Defines the "tables" for the database: `User` (logins), `Transaction` (raw events), `Rule` (automation logic), and `JournalEntry` (double-entry records). It also contains the `init_db_data` function that creates sample data. |
| **`config.py`** | **Configuration**. sets up settings like the database file location (`accounting.db`) and the secret key for secure sessions. |
| **`extensions.py`** | **Helper**. Initializes plugins like `SQLAlchemy` (for database) and `LoginManager` (for authentication) so they can be used across different files without circular import errors. |
| **`build_exe.py`** | **Build Script**. A Python script that tells `PyInstaller` how to package your app into a single `.exe` file. It ensures the templates and CSS files are included inside the EXE. |
| **`setup.iss`** | **Installer Config**. A configuration file for **Inno Setup**. You verify/compile this file to generate the professional `AccountBook_Setup.exe` installer for Windows. |
| **`requirements.txt`** | **Dependencies**. Lists all the external Python libraries needed to run the app (Flask, SQLAlchemy, etc.) and their specific versions. |
| **`accounting.db`** | **The Database**. This file is created automatically when you run the app. It holds all your users, transactions, and settings. If you delete it, the app resets to a fresh state. |

## Templates Folder (`templates/`)
Contains the HTML files for the User Interface.

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`base.html`** | The **Master Layout**. Contains the Navigation Bar, the sidebar logic, and the footer. All other pages "extend" this file so they look consistent. |
| **`login.html`** | The Login page styling. |
| **`dashboard.html`** | The Home page. Contains the **Chart.js** logic for the income/expense graphs. |
| **`transactions.html`** | The Transaction entry form and the main history table. |
| **`journal.html`** | The General Journal view (Admin/Accountant) showing raw Debits/Credits. |
| **`ledger.html`** | The **Account Summary** view. Shows list of accounts (Cash, Sales, etc.) and their current balances. |
| **`account_details.html`** | The **Drill-down** view. Shows the history of a single account (e.g., clicking "Cash" takes you here). |
| **`edit_transaction.html`**| The form used by Admins to modify existing transactions. |
| **`rules.html`** | The Admin-only page to define existing business logic (e.g., "Lunch" maps to "Expense"). |

## Static Folder (`static/`)
| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`css/style.css`** | **Styling**. Custom CSS that rides on top of Bootstrap 5. It implements the "Glassmorphism" look, dark mode colors, and custom card styles. |

## Build Artifacts
| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`AccountBook.spec`** | Generated by PyInstaller. It saves the configuration used to build the EXE. |
| **`dist/` Folder** | The Distribution folder. Your final `AccountBook.exe` appears here after building. |
| **`build/` Folder** | Temporary working files created during the build process. You can safely delete this. |
